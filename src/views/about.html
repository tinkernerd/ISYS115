            <p>
                Welcome to the digital workshop of <strong>Nick Stull</strong>, a.k.a. <em>The Tinkering Nerd</em>. This
                site is my ever-evolving space to share ideas, projects, and experiments.<br> Consider it a fusion of my
                <strong>Digital Notebook</strong>, <strong>Second Brain</strong>, and <strong>Digital Garden</strong>.
                If you enjoy diving into polished tutorials, chaotic brainstorming, or quirky side quests, you’re in the
                right place!
