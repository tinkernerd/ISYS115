        <h1>About The Tinkering Nerd</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the home of <strong>Nick Stull</strong>, better known as <em>The Tinkering Nerd</em>. This is my
            space on the web to share ideas, experiments, and creations. Think of it as my <strong>Digital
                Notebook</strong>, <strong>Second Brain</strong>, and <strong>Digital Garden</strong> rolled into one.

            By the way, I might have ADHD — so expect a delightful array of topics as I follow inspiration wherever it
            leads. Buckle up; it’s a wild ride!

            My passions include programming, home lab tinkering, Raspberry Pi, 3D printing, aviation, networking, and
            photography. On any given day, you might find me debugging Python scripts, creating Docker containers, or
            designing something quirky for my D&D games.

                tinkering."</em> Got questions or ideas? Let’s connect and make something amazing.
